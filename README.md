#            Production: This is a Basic ASP.NET Website that was a creative project.

# The Problem: People do not find time or they might be reluctant to go to pharmacies to buy or fetch medication. This causes sales to decline in terms of people being reluctant to go buy medication and in terms of people not finding time fetch medication, this causes a backlog of stock waiting to be taken.

# Problem-solving apprach: I did a backgroud research to see what causes the problem and took time to understand it, then realising people need a simple and easy to use platform for ordering, paying and receiving a delivery date for they packages.
